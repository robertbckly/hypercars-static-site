# 'Hypercars' Static Site
Simple front-end build from 2019 when I was beginning to write better HTML, but before I had studied modern CSS layout.

However, this example does show:
- Decent HTML, even if lacking use of more semantic elements in places
- CSS custom properties
- BEM CSS methology
- Basic responsive design, using a media query break-point to provide rules for smaller viewports
